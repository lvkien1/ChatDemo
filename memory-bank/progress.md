## Git Ignore Issue
- If `node_modules` is not being ignored:
  1. Confirm `.gitignore` includes `node_modules`.
  2. Run `git status` to check if `node_modules` is tracked.
  3. Verify the directory exists using `ls node_modules`.
  4. Reapply `.gitignore` rules:
     ```bash
     git rm -r --cached .
     git add .
     git commit -m "Reapply .gitignore rules"
