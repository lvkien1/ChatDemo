## Frontend Development Rules

### File Organization
- Use SCSS for styling
- Create separate files for component parts:
  - `.html` for templates
  - `.ts` for component logic
  - `.scss` for component styles
- Place each component in its own directory
- Name popup components with 'Popup' prefix (e.g., `PopupConfirm`, `PopupSettings`)
- CSS Encapsulation:
  - All SCSS rules must be wrapped in `:host` selector
  - Use `::ng-deep` inside `:host` when needed to style child components
  - Avoid global styles outside of `:host` to prevent styling conflicts

## Project Context
- Chat Web App UI implementation based on Figma design
- Angular-based frontend development
- Focus on component-based architecture
- Real-time communication features

## Key Implementation Paths

### Design System
- Extract colors, typography, and spacing from Figma
- Implement using SCSS variables and mixins
- Follow Material Design patterns while maintaining custom design
- Use consistent border-radius (24px for main containers, varied for components)

### Component Structure
- Follow smart/presentational pattern
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Implement proper component communication
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### State Management
- Use NgRx for complex state
- Implement proper actions and reducers
- Follow CQRS pattern
- Maintain clear state structure

## User Preferences
- Clear documentation requirements
- Structured component hierarchy
- Consistent code style
- Regular progress updates

## Project Patterns
1. Memory Bank-first approach for documentation
2. Component-driven development
3. Test-driven development when appropriate
4. Regular progress tracking

## Known Challenges
